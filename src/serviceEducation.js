    title: "Automated Appointment Booking",
    whatItDoes: "Imagine a customer visits your website at 2 AM and wants to book an appointment. Instead of waiting until you're back in the office, they can instantly see your available times and book themselves in - just like booking a table at a restaurant online.",
    howItWorks: "We set up a calendar system that shows your real-time availability. When someone books, it automatically goes into your calendar, sends them a confirmation, and you get notified. No more phone tag!",
    scenarioExample: "Sarah runs a consulting business. Before automation, she spent 2 hours daily playing phone tag to schedule meetings. Now, clients book themselves 24/7, and she gained back 10 hours per week.",
    relatedQuestion: "leadHandling",
    removalWarning: "You mentioned you're losing potential customers because of missed calls or slow response time. Removing this service means customers will still have to call or email you to book appointments, which could result in missed opportunities."
  },
  
  w002: {
    title: "Lead Nurturing & Education Sequence",
    whatItDoes: "When someone shows interest in your business but isn't ready to buy yet, this system automatically sends them helpful emails over time to build trust and keep you top-of-mind - like having a personal assistant who follows up with every lead.",
    howItWorks: "We create a series of 5-7 emails that automatically send to new leads over 2-3 weeks. Each email provides value, answers common questions, and gently reminds them about your services.",
    scenarioExample: "Mike's landscaping company used to lose 70% of leads who said 'let me think about it.' Now, his automated email sequence stays in touch, and 40% of those leads come back to book within 30 days.",
    relatedQuestion: "mainFrustration",
    removalWarning: "You mentioned that leads not converting to customers is a major frustration. Without lead nurturing, prospects who aren't ready to buy immediately will likely forget about you and go with a competitor who stays in touch."
  },
  
  w003: {
    title: "Professional Services Sales Pipeline",
    whatItDoes: "Think of this as a digital filing system that tracks every potential customer from 'just interested' to 'paying customer.' You'll always know exactly where each lead is in your sales process and what to do next.",
    howItWorks: "We set up a visual board (like sticky notes on a wall) where each lead moves through stages: New Lead → Contacted → Proposal Sent → Negotiating → Closed. You get reminders for follow-ups and can see your entire sales pipeline at a glance.",
    scenarioExample: "Jennifer's accounting firm was losing track of prospects in spreadsheets. Now she has a clear pipeline showing 23 active leads, knows exactly when to follow up, and closed 15% more deals last quarter.",
    relatedQuestion: "holdingBack",
    removalWarning: "You indicated that having no clear sales process is holding your business back. Without a sales pipeline, you'll continue managing leads in your head or scattered notes, making it easy to drop the ball on opportunities."
  },
  
  w004: {
    title: "Appointment Reminder System",
    whatItDoes: "Automatically reminds your customers about their upcoming appointments via text and email, so they don't forget and you don't waste time with no-shows.",
    howItWorks: "When someone books an appointment, they get an instant confirmation. Then, 24 hours before, they get a reminder text. One hour before, they get a final reminder. All automatic - you don't lift a finger.",
    scenarioExample: "Dr. Chen's dental practice had a 25% no-show rate costing thousands in lost revenue. After adding automated reminders, no-shows dropped to 5%, and the system paid for itself in the first month.",
    relatedQuestion: "mainNeed",
    removalWarning: "Without appointment reminders, you'll continue experiencing no-shows, which wastes your time and costs you money. Studies show automated reminders reduce no-shows by up to 80%."
  },
  
  w005: {
    title: "Automated Review Requests",
    whatItDoes: "After you complete a job, this system automatically asks your happy customers to leave you a review on Google, Facebook, or other platforms - building your online reputation without you having to remember to ask.",
    howItWorks: "7 days after a service is completed, the system sends a friendly text asking for a review with a direct link. If they don't respond, it sends a gentle email reminder 3 days later. When they leave a review, you get notified and can thank them.",
    scenarioExample: "Tom's HVAC company had 12 Google reviews. After automation, he now gets 3-5 new reviews per month and has 87 five-star reviews, which helped him rank #1 in local search and double his leads.",
    relatedQuestion: "successVision",
    removalWarning: "You mentioned wanting consistent 5-star reviews as part of your success vision. Without automated review requests, you'll have to manually ask every customer, which most business owners forget to do consistently."
  },
  
  w006: {
    title: "Proposal & Signature Automation",
    whatItDoes: "Instead of creating proposals in Word and chasing people for signatures, this creates professional proposals automatically and lets clients sign electronically from their phone - closing deals faster.",
    howItWorks: "We set up proposal templates with your pricing and services. When you're ready to send one, you fill in the client's name, and it generates a beautiful PDF they can sign digitally. You get notified instantly when they sign.",
    scenarioExample: "Rachel's marketing agency used to wait 5-7 days for signed proposals to come back. Now clients sign within hours, and she closes deals 3x faster. She also looks more professional than competitors still using paper.",
    relatedQuestion: "timeline",
    removalWarning: "You indicated you want to see results within 1 month. Without proposal automation, you'll continue the slow back-and-forth of creating proposals manually and waiting for signatures, which delays your sales cycle."
  },
  
  w008: {
    title: "Referral Generation System",
    whatItDoes: "Automatically asks your happiest customers to refer their friends and family, and makes it easy for them to do so - turning your customers into a sales force.",
    howItWorks: "After a successful project, the system sends a message saying 'We're glad you're happy! Know anyone else who could use our services?' with an easy referral link they can share. You can even offer incentives for successful referrals.",
    scenarioExample: "Lisa's cleaning service got maybe 1-2 referrals per year. After automation, she gets 2-3 referrals per month because the system asks every happy customer at the perfect time. Referrals now account for 30% of her new business.",
    relatedQuestion: "successVision",
    removalWarning: "Without a referral system, you're leaving money on the table. Your happy customers would refer you if asked, but most business owners forget to ask consistently. This automation does it for you every time."

  w009: {
    title: "Professional Website Build",
    whatItDoes: "A modern, mobile-friendly website that makes your business look professional and helps customers find you online - like your digital storefront that's open 24/7.",
    howItWorks: "We use proven templates from GoHighLevel and customize them with your branding, services, and contact information. The site is optimized for mobile phones and search engines, and includes contact forms that feed directly into your CRM.",
    scenarioExample: "Mark's construction company had an outdated website from 2010. After getting a new site, his online inquiries tripled, and customers told him they chose him over competitors because his website looked more professional and trustworthy.",
    relatedQuestion: "hasWebsite",
    removalWarning: "You indicated you need a new website. Without a professional website, potential customers will judge your business by your online presence (or lack thereof) and may choose competitors with better websites, even if you offer better service."
  },
  
  w010: {
    title: "Sales Funnel with Payment Portal",
    whatItDoes: "A specialized website designed to sell one specific product or service, with the ability to accept payments online - like having a salesperson and cashier working for you 24/7.",
    howItWorks: "We create a multi-page funnel: a landing page that captures attention, a sales page that explains your offer, a checkout page that accepts payments, and thank-you page. It's designed to guide visitors toward buying, and you can accept credit cards automatically.",
    scenarioExample: "Kevin's coaching program used to require phone calls to close sales. Now his funnel explains everything, answers objections, and lets people buy immediately. He went from 2 sales per month to 15, and he can sell while he sleeps.",
    relatedQuestion: "websiteInterest",
    removalWarning: "You expressed interest in a sales funnel with payment processing. Without this, you'll continue relying on manual sales processes and won't be able to accept online payments, limiting your ability to scale and sell 24/7."
  },
  
  w011: {
    title: "Domain Setup & Configuration",
    whatItDoes: "Gets your business a professional web address (like YourBusiness.com) and sets up all the technical stuff so your website and emails work properly - like getting your business a proper street address.",
    howItWorks: "We help you choose and register a domain name, then configure all the technical settings (DNS, email authentication, SSL certificate) so your website loads, your emails don't go to spam, and everything works securely.",
    scenarioExample: "Amanda bought a domain but couldn't get her website to work or her business email to send properly. After professional setup, everything worked perfectly, and her emails stopped going to spam folders, which improved her response rates.",
    relatedQuestion: "hasDomain",
    removalWarning: "You mentioned needing help getting a domain. Without proper domain setup, your website won't work, your emails may go to spam, and you'll look unprofessional using a Gmail address for business communications."
  },
  
  w012: {
    title: "Social Media Lead Tracking & Attribution",
    whatItDoes: "Tracks which of your social media posts actually bring in customers, so you know what's working and what's wasting your time - like having analytics that show your ROI on every post.",
    howItWorks: "We set up special tracking links for each social media post. When someone clicks and fills out your form, the system automatically tags them with which post they came from. You'll see exactly which posts generated leads and sales.",
    scenarioExample: "Maria's spa was posting on Instagram daily but had no idea if it was working. After tracking, she discovered her 'Sunday Self-Care' posts generated 80% of her social media leads, so she doubled down on that content and tripled her bookings.",
    relatedQuestion: "mainNeed",
    removalWarning: "Without lead tracking, you're posting on social media blindly. You won't know which posts work, which platforms to focus on, or whether your social media efforts are actually generating revenue or just likes."
  },
  
  w013: {
    title: "Social Media Scheduling & Management",
    whatItDoes: "Schedule all your social media posts in advance from one place, and they automatically post to Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, etc. at the best times - like having a social media manager working for you.",
    howItWorks: "We connect your social media accounts to GoHighLevel's Social Planner. You (or we) create a month's worth of posts in one sitting, schedule them, and they automatically post throughout the month. You can schedule posts for the entire year if you want!",
    scenarioExample: "David's real estate business was inconsistent on social media - posting 5 times one week, then nothing for 3 weeks. After scheduling, he posts consistently 3x per week, his followers grew 300%, and he gets 2-3 leads per month from social media.",
    relatedQuestion: "automationInterest",
    removalWarning: "Without scheduling automation, you'll continue the exhausting cycle of trying to remember to post daily, which leads to inconsistent presence, lost followers, and missed opportunities to stay top-of-mind with potential customers."
  },
  
  w014: {
    title: "Social Media Complete Package",
    whatItDoes: "Combines lead tracking AND scheduling into one complete social media solution - you'll know what's working and maintain consistent presence, all while saving $100 on setup and $25/month.",
    howItWorks: "You get everything from both services: schedule posts in advance across all platforms, and track which posts generate actual leads and customers. It's the complete social media automation system.",
    scenarioExample: "Sophie's boutique wanted both services. By bundling, she saved money and got a complete system. She schedules a month of posts in one afternoon, tracks which products get the most interest, and has grown her social media revenue by 250%.",
    relatedQuestion: "mainNeed",
    removalWarning: "The bundle saves you money and gives you complete social media automation. Removing this means you'll either pay more for both services separately, or miss out on either tracking (flying blind) or scheduling (inconsistent presence)."
  },
  
  w015: {
    title: "Basic Website Chatbot",
    whatItDoes: "A friendly AI assistant on your website that answers common questions instantly, 24/7 - like having a receptionist who never sleeps, never takes breaks, and can talk to multiple customers at once.",
    howItWorks: "We add a chat widget to your website with pre-programmed answers to your most common questions (hours, pricing, services, etc.). When visitors ask questions, the bot responds instantly. If it can't help, it collects their info for you to follow up.",
    scenarioExample: "James's IT company was missing leads because people visited his site after hours and left without contacting him. After adding a chatbot, it answers basic questions and collects contact info 24/7. He now gets 15-20 extra leads per month.",
    relatedQuestion: "automationInterest",
    removalWarning: "You expressed interest in chatbot automation. Without it, visitors to your website outside business hours will leave without getting answers, and you'll miss opportunities to capture leads when you're not available."
  },
  
  w016: {
    title: "Custom Chatbot Training",
    whatItDoes: "Upgrades your basic chatbot to be an expert on YOUR specific business - trained on your services, pricing, policies, and FAQs so it can handle complex questions like a trained employee.",
    howItWorks: "We take your business information (services, pricing, FAQs, policies) and train the AI to understand your business specifically. The chatbot can then answer detailed questions about your offerings, quote prices, explain your process, and more.",
    scenarioExample: "Linda's law firm added a basic chatbot, but clients asked complex legal questions it couldn't answer. After custom training with her practice areas and common legal questions, the bot now qualifies leads, explains services, and books consultations - saving her staff 10 hours per week.",
    relatedQuestion: "automationInterest",
    removalWarning: "Without custom training, your chatbot can only handle basic questions. Visitors asking specific questions about your services will get generic responses, which may frustrate them and cause you to lose leads to competitors with better automation."
